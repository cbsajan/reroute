  4. Contract-First Development with Auto-Sync 📜

  What: Start with OpenAPI spec, auto-generate routes, keep them in sync

  # Start with OpenAPI spec
  reroute import openapi.yaml

  # Generates:
  # ✅ Folder structure
  # ✅ Route classes with correct signatures
  # ✅ Pydantic models
  # ✅ TODO comments for business logic

  # Reverse sync
  reroute sync --to-openapi
  # Updates OpenAPI spec based on code changes

  Why Unique: Bidirectional sync between OpenAPI and code is rare, especially with folder structure.

  9. Dependency Injection System 💉

  What: Built-in DI without external libraries

  # services/database.py
  from reroute.di import Injectable

  @Injectable(scope="singleton")
  class DatabaseService:
      def __init__(self):
          self.conn = create_connection()

  # routes/users/page.py
  from reroute.di import Inject

  class UserRoutes(RouteBase):
      db: DatabaseService = Inject()

      def get(self):
          users = self.db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
          return users

  Why Unique: Framework-level DI integrated with folder-based routing.

  reroute install @reroute/search-elasticsearch

  # Creates routes/ folders with:
  # ✅ Complete implementation
